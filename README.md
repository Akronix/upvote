# UpVote
## What's this?
A Question&Answer collaborative site to make decisions using [SwellRT](http://swellrt.org/) technology.
Start asking a question, wait for answer and people will vote which is the rightest one.
Use it to decide what to do this weekend, where to go to eat tonight or the name of your next pet.
It's absolutely real time and can be installed in different networks thanks to SwellRT.
